Implementation of the paper - Predicting Dose-Response Curves with Deep Neural Networks, published at ICML 2024. 
- `run_all_experiments.py` contains driver code for executing the experiments. 
- `train_model.py` contains the training loop for the model
- `optimize_hyperparameters.py` contains the hyperparameter optimization pipeline.
- in `utils.py` utilities for downloading and pre-processing the data are contained
- In FunFor the code from FunFor [1] found at https://github.com/xiaotiand/FunFor was adapted to support multi-threading and covariates with 0 variance.
